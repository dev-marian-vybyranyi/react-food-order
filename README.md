# React Food Order App

A modern, responsive food ordering application built with React.

## Concepts Practiced

This project was built to practice several core and advanced React concepts:

- **State Management**: Extensive use of `useState`, `useReducer`, and `useContext` to manage complex application states (Cart, User Progress, etc.).
- **Forms**: Implementing robust form handling using modern techniques like `useActionState` and the `FormData` API.
- **Custom Hooks**: Creating reusable logic with custom hooks (e.g., `useHttp` for API requests).
- **Context API**: Providing global state across the component tree without prop drilling.
- **Portals**: Using `createPortal` for accessible and clean modal implementations.
- **Side Effects**: Handling API calls and browser interactions with `useEffect`.

## Features

- **Vibrant Meals List**: Fetched from a backend server.
- **Dynamic Cart**: Add, remove, and update quantities of items.
- **Checkout Process**: validation and submission of customer data.
- **Responsive Design**: Styles tailored for different screen sizes.
